## Blockchain Terminology
Feel free to add any terms that are missing from this list, be sure to enter the new word where it's alphabetically appropriate. 

**51% Attack**
A type of attack on a blockchain network where a group of miners controls more than 50% of the network's hashing power. This control allows them to manipulate transactions, including double-spending funds.

**Atomic Swap**
A technology that allows for the direct exchange of one cryptocurrency for another without the need for an intermediary, such as an exchange. Atomic swaps enable peer-to-peer trading across different blockchains.

**Bitcoin**
The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, created by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin operates on a decentralized peer-to-peer network and uses Proof of Work (PoW) for consensus.

**Blockchain**
A distributed ledger technology that records transactions in a secure, transparent, and immutable manner. Each block contains transaction data, a timestamp, and a link to the previous block, forming a chain. Blockchain is the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing trust and security without the need for central authorities.

**Blockchain Trilemma**
A concept describing the difficulty of achieving decentralization, security, and scalability simultaneously in a blockchain. Most blockchains prioritize two of these aspects at the expense of the third, making the trilemma an important consideration for finance professionals when evaluating blockchain projects.

**Cold Wallet**
A cryptocurrency wallet that is kept offline, providing enhanced security for storing funds. Cold wallets are less susceptible to hacking compared to online "hot wallets."

**Consensus Mechanism**
The process used by blockchain networks to validate transactions and add them to the ledger. Common consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), used by Bitcoin, and Proof of Stake (PoS), used by newer blockchains like Ethereum 2.0. Consensus mechanisms are vital to maintaining the security and integrity of the blockchain.

**Cryptocurrency**
A type of digital currency that relies on cryptography for security and operates on blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies can be used for payments, remittances, or as a store of value. Bitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most widely known cryptocurrencies.

**dApps (Decentralized Applications)**
Applications built on blockchain technology that operate without a central authority. dApps leverage smart contracts to provide services such as finance, gaming, and social networking in a decentralized manner.

**DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**
A decentralized organization that operates through rules encoded as smart contracts on the blockchain. DAOs allow for collective decision-making by stakeholders without the need for a central authority, often applied in managing DeFi projects or community-driven ventures.

**Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**
A consensus mechanism where stakeholders elect delegates to validate transactions and create new blocks. DPoS is more efficient than traditional PoS and is used by blockchains like EOS and TRON.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**
A movement that aims to use blockchain and smart contracts to recreate traditional financial systems like banking, lending, and trading without relying on central intermediaries. DeFi applications allow users to lend, borrow, trade, and earn interest using decentralized protocols.

**Double Spending**
A potential flaw in digital cash schemes where the same digital token can be spent more than once. Blockchain prevents double spending by using consensus mechanisms and a distributed ledger.

**Ethereum**
A blockchain platform that enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) using smart contracts. Ethereum is widely known for supporting DeFi, NFTs, and other blockchain innovations. Ether (ETH) is its native cryptocurrency, used to pay for transactions and computational services on the network.

**Flash Loan**
A type of uncollateralized loan available in the DeFi space, where users borrow and repay funds within a single transaction. Flash loans are commonly used for arbitrage opportunities and require no collateral if repaid instantly.

**Fork**
A change to the blockchain protocol that creates a divergence in the chain. Forks can be "hard" or "soft" depending on whether they require all nodes to upgrade to the new rules. Forks are used to implement updates or create new cryptocurrencies.

**Fungible Tokens**
Cryptographic tokens that are identical and interchangeable with each other. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of fungible tokens, as each unit holds the same value and can be exchanged one-to-one.

**Gas Fees**
Transaction fees paid by users to compensate miners or validators for the computational work required to process and validate transactions on the blockchain. Gas fees are particularly relevant in networks like Ethereum.

**Hash Function**
A cryptographic function that takes an input and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which appears random. Hash functions are used in blockchain to secure transaction data and link blocks together.

**Hash Rate**
The measure of computational power used in mining and validating blockchain transactions. A higher hash rate indicates a more secure network, as it becomes harder for attackers to compromise it.

**Hot Wallet**
A cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the internet, used for day-to-day transactions. Hot wallets are convenient but more vulnerable to security threats compared to cold wallets.

**Howey Test**
A legal test used to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract, making it subject to securities regulations. The Howey Test is often applied to cryptocurrencies and tokens to determine if they should be regulated as securities.

**ICO (Initial Coin Offering)**
A fundraising method in which new blockchain projects sell their underlying cryptocurrency tokens to early investors. ICOs are similar to IPOs but operate in the crypto space, often used to raise capital for new ventures.

**Ledger**
A record-keeping system that maintains a list of all transactions on the blockchain. The ledger is shared across all nodes in the network, providing transparency and immutability.

**Liquidity Pool**
A collection of funds locked in a smart contract, used to facilitate trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Liquidity pools provide the liquidity needed for users to trade tokens without relying on a traditional order book.

**Merkle Tree**
A data structure used in blockchain to efficiently and securely verify the integrity of large sets of data. Merkle trees allow for quick verification of transactions without needing to download the entire blockchain.

**Mining**
The process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain by solving complex mathematical problems. Mining is commonly used in Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanisms and rewards miners with cryptocurrency for their efforts.

**Node**
A computer or device that participates in a blockchain network by maintaining a copy of the ledger and validating transactions. Nodes are essential for the decentralized nature of blockchain.

**Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**
Unique digital assets represented on the blockchain, typically used to prove ownership of digital art, collectibles, or other assets. Unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs are indivisible and unique, making them ideal for representing one-of-a-kind items.

**Oracles**
Third-party services that provide external data to smart contracts. Oracles act as a bridge between the blockchain and the outside world, allowing smart contracts to interact with real-world events and information.

**Private Key**
A cryptographic key that is used to access and manage one's cryptocurrency funds. The private key must be kept secure, as it grants full control over the associated funds, similar to a password.

**Private vs. Public Blockchain**

Public Blockchain: An open network that anyone can join and participate in, like Bitcoin or Ethereum. These blockchains are decentralized and transparent.

Private Blockchain: A restricted network where access is limited to specific participants, often used by enterprises for internal operations or collaboration among trusted partners.

**Proof of Stake (PoS)**
A consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral. PoS is more energy-efficient compared to PoW and is used by newer blockchains like Ethereum 2.0.

**Proof of Work (PoW)**
A consensus mechanism that requires participants (miners) to solve computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks. PoW is energy-intensive but provides high security, used by Bitcoin and other early blockchains.

**Public Key**
A cryptographic key that is used to receive funds in a blockchain network. The public key is derived from the private key and can be shared openly, similar to a bank account number.

**Sharding**
A scalability solution that divides the blockchain into smaller, manageable pieces called shards. Each shard processes its own transactions and smart contracts, improving overall network efficiency.

**Sidechain**
A separate blockchain that runs parallel to the main chain and is interoperable with it. Sidechains are used to improve scalability, allowing for faster transactions and reduced congestion on the main blockchain.

**Smart Contracts**
Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Smart contracts automatically execute and verify the conditions of a contract without requiring intermediaries. They are used in various financial applications, such as lending, insurance, and decentralized finance (DeFi).

**Stablecoins**
Cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by pegging them to assets like the US dollar or gold. Stablecoins provide the stability needed for everyday transactions and are used extensively in DeFi to minimize volatility while benefiting from blockchain technology.

**Tokenization**
The process of representing real-world assets, such as real estate or company shares, on the blockchain. Tokenization allows for fractional ownership, increased liquidity, and easier transfer of assets. It plays an essential role in making financial instruments accessible and tradable in the digital space.

**WalletConnect**
An open-source protocol that allows users to connect their cryptocurrency wallets to decentralized applications (dApps). WalletConnect provides a secure way for users to interact with DeFi platforms and other blockchain-based services by using their wallet via QR codes.

**Wrapped Tokens**
Cryptocurrency tokens that represent another asset, typically from a different blockchain. Wrapped tokens allow for interoperability between blockchains, such as Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on the Ethereum network.

**Zero-Knowledge Proof**
A cryptographic technique that allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any specific information. Zero-knowledge proofs are used in blockchain to enhance privacy.
